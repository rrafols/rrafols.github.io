My company has been selected finalist for the _NFC Forum Global Competition &#8211; Touching the Future_ with another nine world-wide companies in the “The Best NFC Service of the Year 2008″. The winners will be announced next tuesday (April 29).  
I designed and developed the J2ME client for [Nokia 6131 NFC](http://www.forum.nokia.com/devices/6131_NFC "Nokia 6131 NFC") which allows you to interact with one of our Touch Screens (<a title="FuturLink's B200TS" href="http://www.futurlink.com/en/products_fitxa.php?nombre=wilico_b200ts" target="_blank">B200TS</a>) via NFC and Bluetooth. I will wait until the competition is over to post more details and some screenshots and a video of the application.
