I know it has been a long time since the last post, but since last summer I was invited to talk at **Mobile World Congress Shanghai** and I still haven&#8217;t talked about the experience I thought it was about time to do so.  
I spoke at the **Transforming Industries Summit** about the transformation we&#8217;re doing in order to retain and attract talent by increasing our exposure and letting the world know what are we doing.

Here is the video of the talk:  


and the slides:

On a last minute notice, I also was designated the chairman of the summit, so with almost no time to prepare and with the help of all the other speakers at the event, I built a short script linking each talk with the following one.

At the end, it was a bit out of my comfort zone and I couldn&#8217;t prepare it as much as I wanted, but was a great experience.

After the event I took some time to enjoy the night skyline from Shanghai seen from The Bund:
