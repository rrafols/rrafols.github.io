In this blog I’ll post the experiences of working developing J2ME applications. It will be mainly focused on the graphical part and how the user may interact with them although there will be non-interactive applications like the one I’m introducing below.  
This was my first attempt to do a 4k intro with J2ME. I’m not proud of the result, but it was made only in one afternoon to increase dramatically the number of compo entries (from 1 to 2). The binary application requires a J2ME Phone with MMAPI + JSR 184 support. In order to install the application you have to send the mtro.jar file to your phone through bluetooth / cable / irda.
