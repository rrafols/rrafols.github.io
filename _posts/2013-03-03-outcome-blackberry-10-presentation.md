Last thursday I did an introduction to BlackBerry10 for Android developers. I focused most on the current limitations and possibilities of the Android Runtime of BlackBerry10 and I&#8217;ve also used some slides explaining how to convert a binary .apk file to a BlackBerry10 .bar file and sign using command line tools. There are, of course, easier tools (eclipse plugin, online repackager) but those don&#8217;t really need an explanation. At the end there is also a very quick introduction to QML/Qt and native vs cascades development.

Something we learned about the event is people is really tired after 4 days of Mobile World Congress and gets a bit lazy if it&#8217;s raining pretty heavily. Luckily the event was live-streamed and there is a recording of the whole presentation.  
Find below some links of the event:
