Last week, I was invited to take part in one of our development communities. The challenge was to explain something different than what are they using every day and, at the same time, make some fun of me ðŸ˜‰  
I just had a small special request, to explain how I created my 2016 [js1k entry](http://blog.rafols.org/2016/04/01/js1k-2016/). So, I used half the session for that purpose and, on the second part, I did a bit of live coding on a HTML5 canvas. As I already imagined I&#8217;d be running out of time, I prepared a bit the example the night before and, after some steps, I cheated and used the snippets I had already prepared (explaining though the steps and changes on every single step)  
At the end, I showed how to build a very simple snowman only using plain 2D primitives, but simulating, _more or less_, a 3D effect.

Below there is the result:
