This last weekend we got the official confirmation from _[Research In Motion](http://www.rim.com/)_ about our proposal to create an official, RIM-Sponsored, Barcelona BlackBerry Developer&#8217;s Group. And it&#8217;s no longer a proposal, it&#8217;s a reality!! Now is time to get as much developers interested and involved in the project and try to do a first meeting as soon as possible.  
Meetings will be held in [Neàpolis](http://www.neapolis.cat). They are an active part of the group and will give us support with infrastructure and communication.
