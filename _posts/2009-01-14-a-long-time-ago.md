Yes.. it has been a long time since last post.. I have been a bit busy (ok.. not the whole 8 months) moving to the Netherlands. Since June-08 I&#8217;m living and working in Enschede, a nice city in the east border of the Netherlands.

Soon I will publish some videos / shots of my work here at [Service2Media](http://www.service2media.com)
