Next week during Mobile World Congress I am going to do a presentation about BlackBerry 10 together with [Jorge del Casar](http://es.linkedin.com/in/jorgecasar), BlackBerry Developer Evangelist in Spain. The event is organized by [GDG Barcelona](http://gdgbarcelona.blogspot.com.es/) and will be held in the _Facultat Inform√†tica Barcelona_  
[googlemaps https://maps.google.es/maps?ie=UTF8&cid=17558281092145204566&q=Facultat+d&#8217;Inform%C3%A0tica+de+Barcelona&gl=ES&hl=en&t=m&ll=41.389415,2.113323&spn=0.005634,0.00912&z=16&iwloc=A&output=embed&w=425&h=350]  
If you&#8217;re a developer it&#8217;s a good opportunity to get to know BlackBerry 10 as we will speak about both html5 and native development.  
Here is the link to the event:
