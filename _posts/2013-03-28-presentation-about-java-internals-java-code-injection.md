Usually on Friday afternoons, while having a social drink, we do some technical presentations to share our knowledge to other colleagues.  
One of the presentations I did was about Java internals, class file format, bytecode and some code injection I had to do. The funny part was after all the work, the &#8216;hack&#8217; was not really needed, but I actually learned quite a lot.  
Here you can find the slides:
