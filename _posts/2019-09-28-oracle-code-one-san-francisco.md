Few days ago I had the great opportunity to speak at Oracle Code One (<https://www.oracle.com/code-one/>). I spoke about the canvas API performance and how to measure it on the modern web track at the conference and it was the first time I was doing a live coding on the stage!

I have been playing with the html canvas for a long time. Specifically, in all the js1k (<https://js1k.com/>) I have taken part and all the (failed ðŸ˜”) intents at js13k (<https://js13kgames.com/>) and I have learned and noticed some performance pains that might be worth sharing with others. There is a lot more content to cover, but it is something for further sessions.

As a side note, I stayed in Mill Valley during the conference days, slightly outside the city, but had some lovely commutes by ferry at both sunrise & sunset!
