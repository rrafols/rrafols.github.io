I live in a rather small and calm city called [Vilanova i la Geltrú](http://www.vilanova.cat), close to Barcelona and to other touristic places like Sitges, most of the time goes completely unnoticed. What applies to tourists also applies to some terms like technology, companies, &#8230; As an example, few months ago there wasn&#8217;t that much movement about mobile technologies but now seems that, slowly, companies and individuals are talking more and more about mobile apps, mobile web, mobile marketing, &#8230; As I already said, some times people doesn&#8217;t know what they need until you show them what are the options or opportunities of this &#8220;new&#8221; technology and then a new need is created for these people.  
This is, of course, a very slow process. Last time I checked we weren&#8217;t yet at Silicon Valley. In Barcelona there are lot of companies, business, technological groups and, in general, global awareness about mobile technologies. Thanks in part because of the Mobile World Congress and the Mobile Wold Capital. I started noticing graphical designers are getting some small (or not that small) mobile projects, web development companies are starting to think how to provide mobile web solutions, and even some mobile app development companies are sprouting (some of them quite promising and some others not really).  
My small contribution to start creating this conscience of mobile apps and mobile technology has been creating, in my free time, some small Android applications for my hometown. Give them a try, they&#8217;re a bit different (in UX/UI than most of the standard Android apps). Here is the list:
